# WISE_computing_heavens

These are the lesson materials for the Women in Science and Engineering class taught by Ian Johnson. This course "Computing the Heavens" focuses on getting high schoolers familiar with the basics of scientific computing and astrophysics. The course is comprised of 10 classes which build a basis for scientific computing by examining what we can and cannot see in the night sky. Lessons and projects are meant to be collaborative and give students a feel for scientific computing and python. Data and images are not owned by me and are for educational use only.
